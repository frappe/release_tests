"""Regression cover for the ``between`` filter operator.

frappe@9978deb859 ("feat: add between operator to evaluate_filters", backport of
PR #41610 as #41622, 2026-08-06) added ``between``/``Between`` to
``frappe.utils.data.operator_map`` and moved ``convert_type_for_between_filters``
out of ``frappe/model/db_query.py`` into ``frappe/utils/data.py``. Before it, the
in-Python filter path returned **False for every between filter** — so Notification
conditions, Assignment Rules and Workflow transitions using ``between`` silently
never fired. After it, they do.

Upstream added unit tests for ``compare()`` semantics. What nothing covers is
**cross-path agreement**: the expansion now lives in three separate places
(``db_query.py``, ``database/query.py``, ``utils/data.py``) and the whole point of
the change is that they should agree. This suite asserts exactly that, over HTTP.

The in-Python path has no stock endpoint, so it is reached through the
``rt_filter_probe`` API Server Script from the customisation pack. On a site
without that pack those steps skip rather than fail.
