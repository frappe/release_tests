"""ERPNext smoke suite (v1 depth: masters + one invoice + one payment).

Flow: ensure Company / Customer / Item masters exist, then submit a single
Sales Invoice and settle it with a Payment Entry. v2 will extend this into the
full Quotation -> Sales Order -> Delivery Note -> Sales Invoice -> Payment ->
reconciliation chain.
